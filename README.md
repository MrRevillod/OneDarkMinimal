## Features

- Clean and minimal design, reducing distractions while coding.
- Based on the renowned "One Dark Pro" theme, providing a polished and professional look.
- Carefully selected colors to ensure optimal readability and comfort during long coding sessions.


## Recommended Extensions

To further enhance your experience with One Dark Minimal, I recommend using the following icon themes:

- File Icon Theme: [Symbols](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/vscode-symbols)
- Product Icon Theme: [Fluent Icons](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/vscode-fluent-icons)

To enable both themes you can add the following lines in your settings.json file

``` json

"workbench.productIconTheme": "fluent-icons",
"workbench.iconTheme": "symbols"

```
